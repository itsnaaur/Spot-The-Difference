# Image Placeholders

This directory should contain the game images for each level.

## Required Images

For each level, you need two nearly identical images:

### Beach Scene (Easy - 5 differences)
- `beach1.jpg` - Original image
- `beach2.jpg` - Modified image with 5 differences

### Jungle Scene (Medium - 7 differences)
- `jungle1.jpg` - Original image
- `jungle2.jpg` - Modified image with 7 differences

### City Scene (Hard - 10 differences)
- `city1.jpg` - Original image
- `city2.jpg` - Modified image with 10 differences

### Space Scene (Expert - 12 differences)
- `space1.jpg` - Original image
- `space2.jpg` - Modified image with 12 differences

### Fantasy Scene (Master - 15 differences)
- `fantasy1.jpg` - Original image
- `fantasy2.jpg` - Modified image with 15 differences

## Image Specifications

- **Recommended Size**: 550x500 pixels
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Quality**: High resolution for better visibility

## Note

The current implementation uses **placeholder images** generated programmatically.
For the full experience, replace these with actual "Spot the Difference" image pairs.

You can create these images using:
- Photo editing software (Photoshop, GIMP)
- Online "Spot the Difference" generators
- Custom photographs with subtle modifications

Make sure the difference coordinates in `LevelManager.java` match the actual 
positions of differences in your images!
